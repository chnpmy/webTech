        <h4>Give the SELECT command to answer the question <span style="color: red">Who will go to the party held in Peking University?</span>
        </h4>

        <p>
            <i>Answer</i> : The SELECT command is <span style="color: blue">SELECT guest.Guest_ID, guest.Guest_Name, guest.E_mail, party.Party_Num, party.Time, party.Place

FROM guest, party, guest_party

        <h4>Figure out a way to obtain the column labels returned by <span style="color: red">mysql_fetch_array</span>.
        </h4>

        <p>
            <i>Answer</i> : The function mysql_fetch_array() has a form like mysql_fetch_array(data, array_type),
            if you let array_type = "MYSQL_ASSOC", the function return the data as an associated array. If you
            travel the keys of the array, you will get the column labels.
