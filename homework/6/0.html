        <h4>What are JavaScript browser sniffers?</h4>
        <br/>
        JavaScript browser sniffers is a kind of browser sniffing technology.
        It's very important for our browsers because the early browsers use different DOMs and the same
        javascript code running on one may not running on another. So, we need to use
        some special Javascript code to find out what the current browser is(Example: IE) and then
        execute different code according to the result, which can let the same code works well
        in all browsers.
